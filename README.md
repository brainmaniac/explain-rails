This project's aim is to become an alternative documentation organizer for Ruby on Rails documentation.

Instead of just listing all available commands Explain Rails is letting you paste a chain with methods and models and automatically links to the relevant sections in the documentation. 

The id√©a comes from this page: https://explainshell.com/
